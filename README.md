# DS-Search-Engine
Final Semester Project

On a partner team, created a search engine that parses through a law corpus of 35,000+ documents. 
The engine's main features include document parser/processor, query processor, search processor, and ranking processor.
User enters a search query, and any documents that satisfy that query are returned to the user ordered by relevance.
